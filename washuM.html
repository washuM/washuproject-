<h1><ul>Unconditional&Conditional LOVE!<ul></h1>
<h1>unconditional love*</h1>
<p>  Unconditional love essentially means loving someone or something without any conditions. In other words, no matter what another person says, does, feels, thinks or believes in, we still love them unconditionally. Unconditional love can also be applied to other beings such as animals and even emotions and thoughts. </p>

<h2>Unconditional love is so vastly different from the love we are used to receiving that most of us don’t really know what it is.</h2>

<p>In fact, most “love” these days isn’t actually true love, but instead differing forms of infatuation, lust,money, affinity, affection,codependency or egotistical  neediness.some people mistake that for love</p>

<p>The reality is that true love is rare and immensely precious. The moment you experience true unconditional love is the moment you feel completely seen, understood, forgiven, accepted, and loved just as you are.

This feeling is the most embracing and liberating sensation you will ever experience.</p>

<h1>conditional love*</h1>
<p>Conditional love is the complete opposite of unconditional love. In fact, conditional love isn’t really “love” in the truest sense of the word, because it comes from the ego, not from the heart.Unlike unconditional love which is given freely, conditional love has to be “earned.” When this false form of love is earned, only then is affection, respect, and kindness given.conditional love is restricted and limited., conditional love is given only when something is received.</p>

<p>Conditional love is inherently selfish and ego-centered. Conditional love only lasts so long as certain unspoken rules are maintained or met. Some of the most common unspoken rules that underpin conditional love include:</p>

<p>¬I will love you only if you make me feel good about myself , I will love you only if you are successful and popular</p>
<p>¬I will love you only if you maintain your attractive looks ,  I will love you only if you do what I say</p>
